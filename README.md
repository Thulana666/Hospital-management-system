# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A full-stack Java-based web application developed as a university group project. The system streamlines hospital operations such as patient management, staff management, appointment scheduling, and payment processing. Built using Servlet technology and MVC architecture, this project demonstrates effective use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a real-world healthcare scenario.

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Used

| OOP Concept       | Where It's Used                              | Purpose                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | In `model/` classes like `Payment`, `Patient` | Keeps class variables private with public getters/setters  |
| **Abstraction**   | Servlet methods and service layer             | Hides internal logic and exposes only necessary interfaces |
| **Inheritance**   | (If used) between servlet/controller classes  | Reuses common logic and promotes cleaner code              |
| **Polymorphism**  | Overriding `doGet()` / `doPost()` in Servlets | Handles different HTTP methods dynamically                 |
